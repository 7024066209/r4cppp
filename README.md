# Rust For C++ Programmers

A Rust tutorial for experienced C and C++ programmers.

Jump to [contents](TODO).
Jump to [contributing](TODO).

This tutorial is intended for programmers who already know how pointers and
references work and are used to systems programming concepts such as integer
widths and memory management. We intend to cover, primarily, the differences
between Rust and C++ to get you writing Rust programs quickly without lots of
fluff you probably already know.

Hopefully, Rust is a pretty intuitive language for C++ programmers. Most of the
syntax is pretty similar. The big difference (in my experience) is that the
sometimes vague concepts of good systems programming are strictly enforced by
the compiler. This can be infuriating at first - there are things you want to
do, but the compiler won't let you (at least in safe code), and sometimes these
things *are* safe, but you can't convince the compiler of that. However, you'll
quickly develop a good intuition for what is allowed. Communicating your own
notions of memory safety to the compiler requires some new and sometimes
complicated type annotations. But if you have a strong idea of lifetimes for
your objects and experience with generic programming, they shouldn't be too
tough to learn.

This tutorial started as a [series of blog posts](TODO). Partly as an aid for me
(@nick29581) learning Rust (there is no better way to check that you ahve learnt
something than to try and explain it to somebody else) and partly because I
found the existing resources for learning Rust unsatisfactory - they spent too
much time on the basics that I already knew and used higher level intuitions to
describe concepts that could better be explained to me using lower level
intutitions. Since then, the documentation for Rust has got *much* better, but I
still think that existing C++ programmers are an audience who are a natural
target for Rust, but are not particularly well catered for.
